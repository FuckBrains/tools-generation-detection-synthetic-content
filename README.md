[StyleGAN](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan) | An alternative generator architecture for generative adversarial networks, borrowing from style transfer literature. The new architecture leads to an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes (e.g., pose and identity when trained on human faces) and stochastic variation in the generated images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it enables intuitive, scale-specific control of the synthesis. The new generator improves the state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics, leads to demonstrably better interpolation properties, and also better disentangles the latent factors of variation. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSLJriaOumA | [![stars](https://badgen.net/github/stars/NVlabs/stylegan)](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan)
